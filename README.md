# Greetings.
I exist and think, learn, feel, perceive, code HTML/CSS/JS and am inclined to Philosophy. Also Sci-Fi stuff. <!-- Wondering if anyone is going to like say I'm weird if I like Transformers. The fiction, not the toy -->

Here's some cool frivolous information:
+ ðŸ“› Pronoun: they
+ Existentialism, though I do not believe that existence precedes essence.
+ Currently working on a *language* and other random code projects.
+ I despise CommonJS and adore [Deno](https://deno.land) + [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org).
+ I don't use CSS stylesheets on my websites.
