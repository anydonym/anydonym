# Greetings.
I exist and think, learn, feel, perceive, code HTML/CSS/JS and am inclined to Philosophy.

Here's some cool frivolous information:
+ ðŸ“› Pronoun: they
+ Existentialist.
+ Currently working on a *language* (usable language, not a "ficitious" one) and other random code projects.
+ Also check out my CSS themes!
+ Imagine a false optimism... nvm, just "Imagine a place"
